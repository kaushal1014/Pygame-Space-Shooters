This is based on my inspiration in gaming 

Pygame uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, with the intention of allowing real-time computer game development without the low-level mechanics of the C programming language and its derivatives. This is based on the assumption that the most expensive functions inside games can be abstracted from the game logic, making it possible to use a high-level programming language, such as Python, to structure the game.

Other features that SDL doesn't have include vector math, collision detection, 2d sprite scene graph management, MIDI support, camera, pixel-array manipulation, transformations, filtering, advanced freetype font support, and drawing.

Applications using pygame can run on Android phones and tablets with the use of pygame Subset for Android (pgs4a). Sound, vibration, keyboard, and accelerometer are supported on Android.
